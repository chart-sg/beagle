2. Install relevant vscode extensions
3. Follow the 'How to use' instructions in Colcon Tasks
4. In a terminal, cd to your workspace and run 'code .' to run vscode in that dir


( Skip these steps if you are using the example as it is)
5. ensure the following are correctly filled up:
	- c_cpp_properties.json (to find the right libraries/include files
